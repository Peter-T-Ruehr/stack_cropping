# stack_cropping
Fiji [1] macro that crops any given image stack without having to load it into memory first.

Work in progress: In its current stage, the converter contains many options only important to our working group. Within the next few days, this will change so it is more user-friendly for the public.

Please cite the following paper when you use this macro:
